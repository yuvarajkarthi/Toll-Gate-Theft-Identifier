# Toll-Gate-Theft-Identifier

Many times when crimes take place over vehicles and it becomes very difficult for polices to check the surveillance camera fixed at toll gates by pausing and checking for each vehicle. The task becomes very tedious and sometimes the culprit may get escaped since humans may make some mistakes. This system could be also helpful to find stolen cars. So, we are about to create an application which can be implemented in toll gates to keep the log of all the vehicles crossing the toll gate.

Until now we have just written the python program to collect 20 datasets for processing purpose, we will convert these 20 sample images to text and find the accurate text in number plate and then we will save the most accurate text at the database with the entry time and date.
